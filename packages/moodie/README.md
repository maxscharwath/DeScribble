# ðŸ˜„Moodie

Moodie is a delightful, lightweight JavaScript library for React that generates SVG-based, expressive avatars from any username and color palette. Inspired by the amazing [boring-avatars](https://github.com/boringdesigners/boring-avatars) project, Moodie aims to take a step further by introducing an array of expressive, fun, and playful avatar faces.

## Features
- Generates unique, vibrant avatars based on any input string
- Offers an assortment of expressions to bring your avatars to life
- Extremely lightweight with no external dependencies
- Fully customizable color palette

```jsx
import { Moodie } from 'moodie';

<Moodie

  expression={{
    eye: 'happy',
    mouth: 'smile',
  }}
  colors={["#92A1C6", "#146A7C", "#F0AB3D", "#C271B4", "#C20D90"]}
/>;
```
